## Design Highlights
* Flexbox for Navigation Menu
* Transitions
* Grid system for layout
* Social Links attached
* mobile-friendly (somewhat)

##
> The final code varries from the screenshot a little bit due to changes applied to the code in the name of making of it responsive

## Opinions
The design is fine on larger screens but it seems kinda childish on mobile screens. The original website is a lot more mature and stable.
Well, the final code changes have been made and I dont have enough motivation to keep on polishing this repository.

###
Every flaw from this design will be noted and taken care of in the next projects.
Moving to SASS ..
